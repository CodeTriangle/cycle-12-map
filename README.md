# Cycle 12 Map

I built this for [the Twelfth Cycle](https://infinitenomic.miraheze.org/wiki/Cycle_12) of [Infinite Nomic](https://nomic.gay), a game of [Nomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic) where all game actions must be submitted by writing them down on a card and posting the image. Specifically, this site will track the map subgame in which players can submit custom art and another player can turn that into a location which will be added to a communal map.

This is a very simple bit of software which displays a 2-dimensional grid of tiles. You can click to move, scroll to zoom, and get more information on a tile by clicking on it. It's even touch-friendly! This is all done in the [VanillaJS framework](http://vanilla-js.com/) using HTML Canvas.

You can add locations from any number of sources with a function call. If you wanted to implement an API to fetch a list of locations, you can do that. I can't stop you. I considered it. For now, I value the stability of GitHub Pages.

Feature requests are welcome, but I only plan on making this as featureful as it needs to be to play the game as described by the rules. That being said, I don't have a problem implementing superfluous features, but they must be fun to implement, otherwise do it yourself. PRs are welcome as well.

Please join Infinite Nomic.
